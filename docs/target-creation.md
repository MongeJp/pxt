# Target Creation

PXT can be customized to create your own **target**, with your own set of APIs and runtime, 
supported by Block-based and JavaScript editing. Examples of targets are:

* https://makecode.adafruit.com (sources at https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-adafruit)
* https://maker.makecode.com (sources at https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-maker)
* https://microsoft.github.io/pxt-sample/ (sources at https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-sample)

We assume that the reader is familiar with Node.JS, NPM, JavaScript and/or C++. If you haven't done so yet, 
install Node.JS and the **PXT** command line

```
npm install -g pxt
```

* Get a copy of the [sample target sources](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-sample) and open it in your favorite editor.
* Open a command prompt in the target folder and run these commands to setup the tools.

```
npm install
```

At this point, pick an identifier for your target. Use only alphabetic characters as it will be used in various routing operations.

## Structure

A target occupies a directory with a [pxtarget.json](/targets/pxtarget) file and the following folders:

* ``/libs``, packages (sometimes referred to as libraries) that define the APIs (in C++, Static TypeScript or Thumb assembler) and how they should be exposed in blocks
* ``/sim``, TypeScript source for the in-browser [simulator](/targets/simulator), if any
* ``/docs``, markdown documentation pages

### Updating ``pxtarget.json``

The [pxtarget.json](/targets/pxtarget) file contains the configuration options of your target. 
For now, update the ``id``, ``name`` and ``title`` fields to reflect your target information.

* Tip: keep searching and replacing all instances of ``sample`` in `pxtarget.json`.

### Updating ``package.json``

Your target will eventually have to be published to NPM,
so go ahead and update the ``package.json`` file with your target id, 
repositories locations, etc.
* it might be a good time to check that your target id is available in NPM as well.

### Updating assets

Graphical assets are located under ``/docs/static``.

* **avatar.svg** image used in talking heads
* **loader.svg** image used in loading overlay

### Home screen

See [targets/home-screen](/targets/home-screen).

### Updating the ``core`` package

The `libs/core` package of *pxt-sample* defines a *minimal* package structure.

In fact,  the APIs of *pxt-sample* live in the `sim/api.ts` (annotated to expose
[TypeScript functions as blocks](/defining-blocks)), as this target is only
for the web. The PXT compiler generates
the file `libs/core/sim.d.ts` from the simulator code.  

See [creating a PXT package](/packages)
for more information on authoring packages, which includes code
in the package itself.
For now, you can try adding a new API to one of the existing namespaces
in`sim/api.ts` with annotations to make a new block. 

### Adding a JavaScript library to your target

There are many useful JavaScript libraries that you might want to use in your target, especially
to make it easier to build the simulator (`sim/simulator.js`). The basic pattern to do this is:

* add the JavaScript file(s) to the directory `sim/public/js`
* include these files in `sim/public/simulator.html` using the `<script>` tag

### Exposing a JavaScript library to TypeScript and Blockly

If you want to make JavaScript functions (from an existing library) available to 
the user of your target (via TypeScript and Blockly), there's more work to do. You
will need to write TypeScript functions to wrap the existing JavaScript functions.
Some JavaScript libraries may already have a TypeScript declaration file available,
which can make the process simpler. 


### Updating the ``templates`` projects

Templates are the default projects for your target. 
There is one default blocks project, and one default JavaScript project.
The initial templates are empty projects.
To change the default project, modify the package under ``libs/blocksprj``

### Testing the target locally

Now that you've updated your target, it is ready to be run locally. Run the following command:

```
pxt serve
```

The editor will automatically open the target API project which you can edit directly in PXT. 
At this point, we recommend to create a new project using blocks that will serve as a sandbox. 
New projects are created under the ``/projects`` folder when testing a target locally (and are automatically "git-ignored"). You can use these projects to change your templates. Simply copy the contents of your project under ``/projects`` to one of the templates under ``/libs/templates/``.

Whenever you make a change, the local web server will trigger a build. Simply reload the page once the build is done.

## Defining APIs and Blocks

The APIs available in the PXT environment are loaded from TypeScript package (library) files
(the ones under ``/libs``). 
They can optionally be [auto-generated](/simshim) from C++ library files or from TypeScript
simulator files.

Read more about [how to annotate your APIS](/defining-blocks) to expose them as blocks in PXT.

## Path rewriting

When uploading to PXT cloud URLs of various files are rewritten to ones pointing to the CDN.
There are three kinds of URLs on the CDN:

* `/blob/<blob_hash>/some/path/filename.ext` - where the path and file name can be arbitrary
* `/commit/<commit_hash>/path/in/that/commit/filename.ext` - where the path actually comes from the commit
* `/tree/<tree_hash>/path/in/that/tree/filename.ext` - where the path actually comes from the tree

Whenever possible, `/blob/` URLs should be used, since they only change when the file changes.
This allows for faster app updates.

For an example, compare https://makecode.microbit.org/---manifest
and https://github.com/microsoft/pxt/blob/master/webapp/public/release.manifest

Generally, PXT will rewrite URLs starting with `/cdn/` to `/commit/...` and ones starting
with `/blb/` to `/blob/...`. This happens in manifest and HTML files, as well as some JavaScript
files (web worker sources and `embed.js`). Part of that rewriting happens client-side when uploading
(strings like `@commitCdnUrl@` and `@blobCdnUrl@` are introduced), and part happens in the cloud.

Currently, in simulator files only, all of `/cdn/`, `/sim/` and `/blb/` are rewritten
to `/blob/...`. Going forward however, simulator files should use `/blb/` explicitly
to make the intent clear.

The main reason to use `/cdn/` instead of `/blb/` is when resources require relative paths.
This is for example the case for Blockly media files.

The `/tree/...` URLs are not yet supported in rewriting.
