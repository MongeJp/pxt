# MakeCode Assignments in Teams

[Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/products/teams/default.aspx) is a collaboration hub for Office 365 where Educators can organize student groups into classes with content, conversations, apps, and assignments all in one place.

Weâ€™re excited to announce a new Teams feature for Educators who are teaching with MakeCode.
You can now create MakeCode programming assignments for your students by attaching a MakeCode project.
Students can then open the MakeCode editor and complete the assignment without ever leaving Teams!

For more information, Educators can read the [documentation](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-makecode-activities-to-assignments-in-microsoft-teams-57365fa8-b6f1-4f3d-bbd9-19ac6eeaacbb) on how to add MakeCode projects to assignments.

To turn this feature on, the IT Administrator of an Office 365 Education [tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/education/get-started/set-up-office365-edu-tenant) needs to complete these steps:

1. Go to the Teams **Admin Center** and navigate to the [Assignments](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/assignments) section. 
2. Next to the **MakeCode** option, click the **On** toggle button and then click the **Save** button.
