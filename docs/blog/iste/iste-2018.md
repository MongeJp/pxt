Douglas & Mary Kiang, both Minecraft Mentors and authors of the [Intro to CS Minecraft](http://aka.ms/intro2csminecraft) curriculum, will be talking about why Minecraft is such a powerful and engaging teaching and learning platform, and leading you through some hands-on coding challenges to make pigs bounce and cows fly through code!

#### 3:20pm - 4:10pm : MakeCode Arcade Beta feedback session

Sneak a peek of Microsoft MakeCode Arcade Beta â€“ a brand new retro 1980â€™s game development platform. Weâ€™ll get hands-on developing simple 2D sprite-based games in both blocks and JavaScript. Then weâ€™ll spend time discussing the 
experience, capabilities, and APIâ€™s of the platform. Come join the discussion and provide your input and expertise to help us design this new MakeCode solution!

## Microsoft Hands-on Learning Room

### McCormick Place West 185A

Weâ€™ll be running ongoing one-hour hands-on workshops in the Microsoft HOL room throughout the conference. Youâ€™ll get to code games, design colored light displays, and make robots dance. Walk away with curriculum and projects you can implement in your classroom. Come drop in for a session or two â€“ we promise it will be fun! No prior experience required.
