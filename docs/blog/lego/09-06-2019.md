# Microsoft MakeCode for LEGO® MINDSTORMS® Education EV3 v1.1.19

Today we released a few bug fixes for the https://makecode.mindstorms.com editor
and a couple new blocks.

## Open source!

It is worth mentioning that this editor has been open source for a quite a while now. We thank all our users who have been reporting issues and submitting pull requests on the project!

* GitHub repo: https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-ev3

## First LEGO League

For teams planning to use MakeCode the FLL [City Shaper](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/fll/2020/city-shaper-game-guide-pdf.pdf) challenge, read the [FLL + MakeCode](https://makecode.mindstorms.com/fll) page. Good luck in competitions! 

## Offline app

Install the [offline app](https://makecode.mindstorms.com/offline-app) to run the editor when you're not connected, or you don't always have access to the internet.

## More tutorials and examples

We have been adding more content on the home screen to help you get started. Check it out!

## Bug fixes

We fixed a number of [user-reported issues](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-ev3/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aclosed). 

* [always exit](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-ev3/issues/849) Sometimes, programs with tight loops
would prevent the ESC button to work.
* [multiple sensor initialization](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-ev3/issues/847) Using multiple sensors would introduce a 6 second delay.
* [gyro reset takes too long](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-ev3/issues/846) Gyro reset is now immediate. We have added a new **calibrate** block that does a more extensive reset procedure.
* [tank woes](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-ev3/issues/844) The **tank** block would... tank for some values.
* [deleting files on the brick](https://makecode.mindstorms.com/fll) We have prepared a special program that lets you delete UF2 files from the brick. Download [these PDF instructions](https://makecode.mindstorms.com/file-manager.pdf) and drop the PDF on the brick drive. This will present you with an menu for deleting files.

## Modified blocks

## [calibrate gyro](https://makecode.mindstorms.com/reference/sensors/gyro/calibrate)

Our users complained that resetting the gyro was very slow and unreliable. 
The calibration logic in gyro [reset](https://makecode.mindstorms.com/reference/sensors/gyro/reset)
has been moved to a new block **calibrate**. 
The **reset** block now simply sends a reset command to the sensor.

## [set brake settle time](https://makecode.mindstorms.com/reference/motors/motor/set-brake-settle-time)

The motor used to have a 200ms brake settle time, the time to pause after braking to allow the robot to stabilize.
The default brake settle time has been reduced to 10ms and a new block, **set brake settle time** has been added
to specify that value. (Thanks [maximmasterr](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-ev3/pull/878)
and [THEb0nny](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-ev3/pull/875))

## New blocks 

### [ramp](https://makecode.mindstorms.com/reference/motors/motor/ramp)

The **ramp** block under **motors** allows to schedule speed with a ramped acceleration and
deceleration phase. This allows you to create smoother movement for your robots

### [set run phase](https://makecode.mindstorms.com/reference/motors/motor/set-run-phase)

This block allows to configure a default acceleration and/or deceleration phase for a motor.
It gets automatically applied once you use the [run](https://makecode.mindstorms.com/reference/motors/run) block on the motor.

### [battery property](https://makecode.mindstorms.com/reference/brick/battery-property)

The **battery property** block under **brick** lets you query the state of your battery:
charge level, voltage and current. You can use it to detect low battery situation proactively. (Thanks to [maximmasterr](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-ev3/pull/899))

### Raw RGB colors

We also added the ability to read the raw color values and raw reflected light from the color sensor. (Thanks to [THEb0nny](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-ev3/pull/876))

### storage (beta!)

The **storage** extension allows to write data to files. The generated files will automatically be deleted once the brick is restarted. You can use this extension to collect and analyze data from your robot.

## Support for I2C

We thank our user [maximmasterr](https://github.com/maximmasterr) for submitting support for I2C sensor. It is now possible to write extensions for additional EV3 sensors, see [example](https://github.com/maximmasterr/pxt-ev3-hiTechnicColorSensor).
