# Minecraft Hour of Code

[Minecraft: Education Edition](https://education.minecraft.net/) is a version of the Minecraft game designed specifically for schools and usually requires an [Office 365 Education](https://education.minecraft.net/get-started/) account. But, for the first time ever, anyone can try Minecraft: Education Edition through a free [Hour of Code](https://education.minecraft.net/hour-of-code) lesson using MakeCode!!

If you’ve ever thought about using Minecraft for teaching and learning, but haven’t taken the plunge yet, this is a great time to try it out! You’ll just need to download the game at https://education.minecraft.net/hour-of-code and play the demo world.

The Hour of Code lesson will introduce you to your **Agent** (a cute loveable robot) which you will program and train to detect fire hazards and then save a village from fire. This lesson is also an introduction to the concepts of [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-malmo/) – using data and pattern analysis to create rules and heuristics.

Here’s a quick tour around this new Minecraft: Education Edition Hour of Code experience –
