# Microsoft MakeCode for Minecraft

**Posted May 2nd, 2017**

[Microsoft MakeCode](https://makecode.com/) is a platform that combines the magic of Making with the power of Coding as a more inclusive approach to computer science education.  Using a hands-on approach to computing education, Microsoft MakeCode brings computer science to life for all students with fun projects, immediate results, and both block and text editors for learners at different levels.  Microsoft MakeCode supports physical computing devices like the micro:bit, and Circuit Playground for students to create robots, digital air guitars and magic wands.

Today the Microsoft MakeCode team is happy to announce their beta release for Minecraft: Education Edition.  [Minecraft: Education Edition](https://education.minecraft.net/) is a version of Minecraft that was created specifically for teachers and students as an immersive learning platform.  Minecraft: Education Edition is available for purchase by schools, libraries, and museums – find out if you’re [eligible to purchase](https://education.minecraft.net/how-it-works/tech-specs/).  

With this latest update, Minecraft has added a Code Connection companion app which allows teachers and students to use [Microsoft MakeCode for Minecraft](https://minecraft.makecode.com/) to program mini-games, automated builds, and change gameplay behavior in Minecraft!
Using either the visual block-based editor, or the JavaScript editor, students can build programs that will spawn animals, construct buildings, alter game settings, or interact with their personal agent.  

Here are some of the cool new features of Microsoft MakeCode for Minecraft:

### Chat Commands 

Students can group their code into Chat Commands which they can call directly from the game.

###	Blocks to Text Programming Progression 

Once students have mastered drag-and-drop, block-based program construction, they can move into a full-featured JavaScript editor with code snippets, tooltips, and error detection to help them.  Students can also switch back and forth between blocks and JavaScript as they make this transition.

###	Easy Build tools 

One of the things students and teachers most enjoy is building in Minecraft.  Microsoft MakeCode gives you tools to automate builds that make creating a Pyramid, a House, or a Roller Coaster easy!

###	Minecraft Block Manipulation

Want to create a tunnel of diamonds, or print your name in the sky?  No problem!  With a few blocks/lines of code, it’s all possible.

###	Helpful troubleshooting tools

 The real-time game command window shows you exactly what game commands are being issued from your code.  “Slo-Mo” lets you slow your program execution down, and highlight which parts of your program are running.
