# Cartoon Network Projects for the Circuit Playground Express

**Posted:** January 7th, 2019 by [Jaqster](https://github.com/jaqster)

Happy New Year! And what better way to start 2019 than with a series of brand-new projects for [Circuit Playground Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333) inspired by [Cartoon Network](https://www.cartoonnetwork.com/)!

Our good friends at [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/about) introduced us to the awesome Cartoon Network team last year, and we all immediately connected – like peanut butter, jelly and wonder bread! All of us are passionately dedicated to the idea that technology is an incredibly creative medium, and all young people should feel empowered to express themselves through this medium – both in the digital world and the physical world.

Last summer the [MakeCode](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/makecode) team took a field trip to visit Cartoon Network to get to know them better.

The more we learned, the more we felt this was going to be an amazing partnership – what we love about Cartoon Network is that they are one of the very few media companies that are completely Open Source – they encourage kids to use their IP and creative assets to express themselves and unlock their own creativity through the characters and shows they love.  And their shows are so unique, quirky and imaginative, representing a diversity of perspectives and cultures.

## New Projects

We created an initial set of seven fun and easy [projects](https://makecode.adafruit.com/projects/cartoon-network) that you can make with inexpensive materials and your Circuit Playground Express:

The official partnership announcement from Microsoft can be found **[here](https://educationblog.microsoft.com/2019/01/microsoft-makecode-cartoon-network-and-adafruit-team-up-to-inspire-a-new-generation-of-creators/)**, and you can find out more about the **[program](http://www.createwithcn.com/)** from Cartoon Network. If you’re an Educator doing these projects in class, there’s also a [Flip Grid template](https://flipgrid.com/makecodecn) you can use for your students to share their finished projects.

Happy Making and Coding!
