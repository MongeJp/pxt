We are so excited to partner with [Rob Morrill](https://twitter.com/morrill_rob) on this new [curriculum](https://makecode.adafruit.com/courses/maker) for the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express. Rob is an amazing Maker Educator who really embodies the philosophy of [Constructivism in the Classroom](https://www.bing.com/search?q=constructivism+in+the+classroom) and has helped his students see themselves as Creators, Problem-seekers and solvers. And I love Rob’s down-to-earth approach to Making – "you don’t have to be a whiz with soldering irons or laser cutters to do any of these projects. If I can do it, then anyone can!"

## What's in the course?

Well, the course is divided into 2 parts...

### General Reference

This section includes helpful [Maker Tools and Techniques](https://makecode.adafruit.com/courses/maker/general/maker-tools-techniques), like what’s the difference between 180-degree and continuous servo motors? and where can you buy them? Or what’s the best way to cut cardboard, or sew conductive thread?

There’s also a section on [Coding Tips](https://makecode.adafruit.com/courses/maker/general/coding), like when should I use **Play Sound** versus the **Play Tone** block? Or how should I use Variables in my project? Or which blocks should I use to code a NeoPixel strip or servo motor?

Lastly, there’s some information about how to download, share and manage your MakeCode project files.

### Projects

This is a project-based curriculum that includes 12 different [projects](https://makecode.adafruit.com/courses/maker/projects) scaffolded from easiest to more difficult and aligned to academic subject areas. Each project includes information on the time required, materials required, academic subject tie-in ideas, and the full step-by-step Making and Coding instructions. The projects include building a [Balance Board](https://makecode.adafruit.com/courses/maker/projects/balance-board), a [Marble Run](https://makecode.adafruit.com/courses/maker/projects/marble-run), a storytelling [Light Box](https://makecode.adafruit.com/courses/maker/projects/light-box), and a [Gondola](https://makecode.adafruit.com/courses/maker/projects/gondola) that can travel across the classroom!

The course is packed with how-to videos and lots of images that make it easy to follow along with the instructions. I guarantee your students will have a blast creating these projects – I know we did!

Hope you have fun Making and Coding with this [curriculum](https://makecode.adafruit.com/courses/maker)!
