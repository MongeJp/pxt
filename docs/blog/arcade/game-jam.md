# MakeCode Arcade Game Jam

![Arcade Game Jam banner](/static/blog/arcade/game-jam/game-jam.gif)

We’re super excited to announce the first-ever [MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com/) game jam! Starting next Monday, September 16th, we’ll be hosting a week-long game hackathon—join the community on the [MakeCode forums](https://forum.makecode.com/) or [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/ypvQNWy) as we spend the week designing games!

In the spirit of [WarioWare, Inc.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HufLIWd0vTk), you'll create a micro-game that can be played in 5 seconds. Afterwards, we'll combine these individual micro-games into one continuous game so your creation, along with those from everyone else, can be played back-to-back. There are no restrictions on theme or game mechanics, as long as the game ends in just five seconds.
