# Micro:bit Editor v0.12.35

**Posted on June 13th, 2017**

This release introduces migrated the domain name **pxt.microbit.org** to **makecode.microbit.org**
to finalize the migration to the **Microsoft MakeCode** brand.

* release tag: https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt-microbit/releases/tag/v0.12.35

## Do I need to do anything?

For Microsoft Edge, IE, Chrome, you should not have to do anything. The migration will be seamless and all existing **pxt.microbit.org** should be automatically redirected to **makecode.microbit.org**. If you had to unlock the microbit domain, see the [unlocking domains](#domains) section below.

In Safari, go to ``Projects``, then ``Import Old projects``. This will open a page that allows you to open each project one by one.

### ~ hint

You may need to refresh your browser once to trigger the import of projects from pxt.microbit.org.**

## What will happen to my scripts?

When you load the editor in https://makecode.microbit.org,
it should automatically import all existing programs under https://pxt.microbit.org .
This migration process will happen once per browser.

## What about .hex files?

The program source is attached to each ``.hex`` file. You can drag and drop
``.hex`` file generated by **pxt.microbit.org** into **makecode.microbit.org**.

## Unlocking domains #domains

The **https://makecode.microbit.org/** should be added to the list of domains to unlock. See the full list of domains at https://makecode.microbit.org/faq .

### ~ hint

If you are unable to unlock makecode.microbit.org, you can temporarily navigate to

 * **https://pxt.microbit.org/?legacy**

However, please note that this workaround will be disabled on July 22nd 2017.
