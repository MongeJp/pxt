# Micro:bit Editor v0.13.20*

**Posted on September 8th, 2017**

Today, the Microsoft MakeCode team is pleased to announce accessibility support for the [micro:bit](https://makecode.microbit.org) editor. According to the National Center for Education Statistics ([NCES](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_cgg.asp)). In the United States, 13% of all public school students receive special education services. Additionally, in the UK, 18% of students have special education needs according to the [Department for Education](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/children-with-special-educational-needs-an-analysis-2013). Weâ€™re committed to ensuring that Microsoft MakeCode is designed for for all students, and today is a first step in that journey.

Some of the accessibility features we have released today include:

## Keyboard navigation

Students can use the **Tab** key to navigate through menus and controls on the page.

## Assistive technologies

Students who have a visual impairment can use screen readers, such as [Narrator](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/22798/windows-10-narrator-get-started), for audible navigation and identification of visual elements. The JavaScript editor also offers additional features for assistive technologies.
