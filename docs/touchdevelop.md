## More information

At Microsoft, we continually evaluate and invest in building the right tools to help every student learn the computer science skills they need to succeed in the future. We determined we needed to replace Touch Develop with [MakeCode](https://www.makecode.com) in order to provide a more holistic, hands-on computing education platform that will bring computer science to life through physical computing devices like the [micro:bit](https://microbit.org) and immersive experiences like Minecraft. We have designed several games-based [courses](https://arcade.makecode.com/courses) that use [MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com).
