# Building your own extension

## Step 1: Design blocks in the editor

It is easiest to tinker and design your blocks from the editor itself. Use the [custom blocks feature](/defining-blocks) for this purpose.

## Step 2: GitHub setup

You will need to get a [GitHub](https://github.com) account and create a GitHub repository. At this time, other repository hosting solutions (GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.) are not supported.

Let's say you want to create an extension called `banana` for target `TARGET`.

* **create** the repository in GitHub
* **clone** the repository into `pxt-banana`
* go to the folder for this repo

## Step 3: Unpack your code

Install the PXT [command line](/cli) and use it to unpack the sources from a compiled file generated by clicking on ``Download``.

* setup the target
```
pxt target TARGET
```

* unpack the file
```
pxt extract  HEXFILE
```

* build the project
```
pxt build
```

* edit `pxt.json` and `README.md` with the right descriptions
* commit files to git: `git add .`, and commit them: `git commit -m "Initial"`

> **Make sure you keep the line `for PXT/TARGET` (where `TARGET` is the target id) in `README.md`. Otherwise, the extension will not show up in search.**

## Step 4: Developing extension

Now, you're ready to develop your extension. You can do it with [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
or from the web editor served from `pxt serve`.

* put the contents of your extension in `main.ts`
* add a sample program using the extension in `test.ts`
* use `pxt` to build and deploy the extension with tests; use the web editor to test in the simulator

You will develop your extension in `pxt-banana`, and then test this work by creating a second project (called, perhaps, "Just Look At It") which includes a reference to `pxt-banana`. 

### ~ hint

If the local editor fails to open, copy the URL printed in the console and open it in your favorite browser. 

The local server requires a security token embedded in the URL to serve pages.

## Step 5: Testing

In order to test your extension, you need to create a new project, and manually add a reference back to the extensin you've been developing.

* Open the local editor and create a new project. For example, you might call it *Just Look At It*.
* Open the project settings by clicking the gear (Gear -> ``Project Settings``)
* Click on ``Edit Settings As Text``
* Add an entry under ``dependencies`` that points to your extension folder:

```typescript-ignore
{
    "name": "banana test",
    "dependencies": {
        ...
        "banana": "file:../pxt-banana"
    },
    ...
}
```

* Reload the editor and the new blocks you developed in `pxt-banana` will be loaded into the project "Just Look At It."

## Step 4: Publishing your extension

When you're happy with the first version of your extension, commit the changes and
bump the version and push to github:

```
git commit -a -m "Amazing flying bananas"
pxt bump
```

The `pxt bump` will make sure there are no uncommited changes, bump the version number,
create a git tag, and push everything to github.

In the editor, paste the full URL to your repo after selecting `Settings -> Extensions`. Your extension should show up.

## Step 5: Approval

In order to be searchable by users, extensions need to be approved. GitHub organizations or individual repos can be approved.

See [approval](/extensions/approval) for more details.

### ~ hint

**Make sure you keep the line `for PXT/TARGET` (where `TARGET` is the target platform id) 
in `README.md`. Otherwise the extension will not show up in search.**

### ~

Read more on [defining blocks](/defining-blocks) to learn how to surface your APIs into blocks and JavaScript.

### Icon

The editor will automatically use any ``icon.png`` file when displaying the extension in the editor. **This feature only works for approved extensions.**

The icon should be sized with a 16:9 ratio and of at least ``184`` pixels wide.
