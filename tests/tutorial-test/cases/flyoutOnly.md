# Explicit Hints

### @diffs false
### @flyoutOnly true

## Introduction

Tutorials can choose to pin the flyout and display all blocks, rather than use the toolbox. This metadata is parsed and removed.

## Step with hint

Tutorial parsing for hints, steps, etc should function exactly as before.

```blocks
let x = 8;
let y = x + 2;
```

```ghost
basic.showIcon(IconNames.Square)
```
